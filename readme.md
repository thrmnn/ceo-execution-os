### Anti-Paralysis Protocol (Immediate Use When Stuck)

```
WHEN YOU NOTICE: Circular thinking, tension, avoidance

STEP 1: EXTERNALIZE (2 min)
  Write: "I'm stuck on [decision/task] because [fear/uncertainty]"

STEP 2: CONSTRAINT (3 min)
  Set 25-min timer: "I will decide by then"

STEP 3: SIMPLIFY (5 min)
  Binary choice:
    Option A: [simplest forward path]
    Option B: [alternative]
    If equal → flip coin (action > perfection)

STEP 4: COMMIT (10 min)
  Document decision + why
  Tell 1 person (social commitment)
  Take first action now (momentum)

RULE: 20-min decisions for non-life-threatening choices
      Course-correct later if needed
```

## CIRCUIT BREAKER PROTOCOL

### Auto-Trigger Conditions

```
Activate if ANY:
[ ] 5+ paralysis episodes/month
[ ] Completion <60% for 2 weeks
[ ] Tension >10 days/month
[ ] 2+ projects stuck on my decisions >1 week
[ ] Sleep <6hrs for 3+ nights
[ ] Avoiding system itself
```

### Override Actions (24 hours)

```
IMMEDIATE:
1. 🛑 Stop new commitments
2. 🎯 Pick ONE project to ship this week
3. ✂️ Kill/delegate rest temporarily
4. 📞 Call [external trigger person]
5. ⏰ 25-min decision sprint with them:
      List avoided decisions
      Make calls with accountability
      Document to prevent revisit

WEEK 1-2: COMPLETION MODE
  • Daily = finish something small
  • No new decisions
  • Ship velocity > size
  • Celebrate every completion

WEEK 3+: RETURN WHEN
  ✓ Shipped 3+ things in 2 weeks
  ✓ Made 5+ decisions without spiral
  ✓ Tension <3 days/week
  ✓ External support engaged
```

### External Trigger Authority

```
Name: _____________________
Role: _____________________
Phone: _____________________

Can invoke if observing:
  • Decision loops
  • Dragging projects
  • Control blocking team

Script: "Circuit breaker. ONE thing to ship 
         this week. Everything else waits."
```

## ANTI-PARALYSIS TOOLBOX

### Decision Speed Framework

```
DECISION TYPE → TIME → METHOD

🔴 Reversible + Low stakes:
   20 min → Flip coin if equal

🟡 Reversible + High stakes:
   48 hrs → Consult 1 advisor, decide
   
🔵 Irreversible + High stakes:
   1 week → Gather data, decide by deadline

MOST DECISIONS ARE 🔴
You can course-correct almost anything
```

### Completion Rituals

```
DAILY (end of day):
  "What did I finish?"
  Write it down
  Text 1 person

WEEKLY (Friday 4pm):
  Review completion scorecard
  If >3 shipped: [your reward: _____]
  Journal: "What felt good?"

MONTHLY (after review):
  If 80%+ early: [celebration: _____]
  Share with team/advisor
  "I'm becoming someone who ships"
```

### Control Release Practice

```
WEEKLY:
  Pick 1 thing held too tight
  Write: "If [person] does this differently, 
         that's OK because ____"
  Don't check for [X days]

MONTHLY:
  Who took initiative without asking?
  → Celebrate this
  
  What returned that shouldn't?
  → Fix handoff or acknowledge pattern
```

## IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### Week 1: Pattern Recognition

- Just notice, don't act yet
- End of day: "Did I notice? When?"

### Week 2: Break Pattern
- Use 20-min protocol when stuck
- Make 3+ forced decisions
- Document each one

### Week 3: Track Completion
- Friday: count what shipped
- Calculate early/on-time %
- Text someone about one win

### Week 4: First Delegation
- Pick one thing
- 15-min handoff
- Don't check for 1 week
- Celebrate if they handle it

### Month 2: Full System
- Weekly reviews
- Monthly strategy
- All metrics tracked

### Quarter 1: External Support
- First quarterly review
- Validate progress
- Adjust as needed

---

## YOUR CUSTOM MANTRAS

**Decision Paralysis:**
"Done > Perfect. Course-correct anything except inaction."

**Control:**
"Different ≠ Wrong. Their way might be better."

**Shipping:**
"Every completion rewires my brain."

**Perfectionism:**
"Doesn't need to be my best. Needs to be done."

---

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### ✅ DO:
1. Start Week 1 only - phased rollout
2. Track completion weekly - feedback loop
3. Name external trigger TODAY
4. Celebrate every ship - rewire brain
5. Use 20-min rule religiously

### ❌ DON'T:
1. Implement all at once
2. Skip paralysis check
3. Make exceptions to forced deadlines
4. Delegate without 15-min handoff
5. Judge yourself for paralysis

---

## FINAL REMINDER

**Purpose:** Ship more projects, earlier, with less stress.

If any component makes that harder, change it.

System serves you. Not vice versa.

**New identity:** CEO who ships early and delegates well.

Everything else supports that.
